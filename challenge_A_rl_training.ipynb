    "# **RL4AA'25 Challenge Part 2:** Option RL\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you can solve the RL challenge by training your own RL agent. If you are a beginner in RL, we recommend you stick the with provided code using the PPO implementation from _Stable Baselines3_, and try to tune the hyperparameters of both the environment and the PPO algorithm through the `config` dictionary. If you are more experienced, feel free to change the algorithm or move to a completely different RL library altogether, provided you believe that it will help you solve the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING THE NOTEBOOK\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a good RL agent can take a lot of time. The task in this challenge was designed such that 500,000 steps should be enough to solve it well. (Though you can train longer if you think you can do better. 😉) On a Mac with an Apple-made SoC, such a training should be doable in about 10 minutes. It may take longer on other machines, expect at least 30 minutes on a recent Windows or Linux laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More importantly** this training can use a considerable amount of RAM. In the worst case, this can also cause other applications to crash when you start training. So please make sure you have nothing unsaved open on your computer before you start training, and that you follow the instructions on setting `n_envs` correctly. When in doubt use a lower number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code also uses (_Weight & Biases_)[https://wandb.ai] to log the training. We recommend you create a free account there and check out the results to better understand what is happening during training. If you don't want to use _Weight & Biases_, run `wandb disabled` in a terminal in the root of this repository. You can then still use Tensorboard to visualise the training progress by running `tensorboard --logdir log/` in a terminal in the root of this repository.\n"
